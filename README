Simple OpenCV-based game, where a Boo from Mario is displayed on your webcam footage. It advances when it's not being looked at, and  stops and hides when it's looked at. When it reaches the screen, it fades and plays a sound, and the game starts again.

Setup ---

sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake
sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
sudo apt install python3-virtualenv
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
virtualenv venv
./venv/bin/pip install opencv-python
./venv/bin/pip install opencv-contrib-python
./venv/bin/pip install playsound

Download raw.githubusercontent.com_opencv_opencv_master_data_haarcascades_haarcascade_frontalface_alt2.xml
and put it in haarcascade_frontalface_alt2.xml

Download boo laugh sound from http://soundfxcenter.com/video-games/super-mario-64/8d82b5_SM64_Boo_Laugh_Sound_Effect.mp3 , put it in sounds/boo-laugh.mp3

Download a couple of images for the boo - one advancing, one hiding - and ensure they have transparent backgrounds. Put them in images/boo-transparent.png and images/boo-hiding-transparent.png.
